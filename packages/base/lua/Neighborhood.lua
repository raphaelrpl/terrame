--- A Neighborhood is a set of pairs (cell, weight), where cell is a neighbor Cell and weight
-- is a number storing the relation's strength.
-- Each Cell can have one or more Neighborhoods to represent its proximity relations. \
-- This type is used to create Neighborhoods from scratch to be used by
-- Cell:addNeighborhood(). To create well-established Neighborhoods see
-- CellularSpace:createNeighborhood(). Neighborhoods can also be loaded from external soures
-- using CellularSpace:loadNeighborhood().
-- It is recommended that a Neighborhood should contain only Cells that belong to the same
-- CellularSpace, as it guarantees that all its Cells have unique identifiers.
-- Calling Utils:forEachNeighbor() from a Cell traverses one of its Neighborhoods.
-- @arg data.... Attributes with only internal purposes. They should not be used explicitly by the user.
-- @output cObj_ A pointer to a C++ representation of the Neighborhood. Never use this object.
-- @usage n = Neighborhood()
-- n = Neighborhood{}
