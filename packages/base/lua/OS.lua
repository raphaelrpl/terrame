--- Return a Directory with the current working directory.
-- @usage cdir = currentDir()
-- print(cdir)
function currentDir()
	return Directory(lfs.currentdir())
end

--- Return if a given file path exists.
-- @arg file A string with a file path.
-- @usage print(isFile("abc.lua"))
function isFile(file)
	mandatoryArgument(1, "string", file)

	return lfs.attributes(file, "mode") == "file"

--- Return if a given path represents a directory that exists.
-- @arg directory A string with a path.
-- @usage print(isDirectory("/home/user/mydirectory"))
function isDirectory(directory)
	mandatoryArgument(1, "string", directory)

	return lfs.attributes(directory, "mode") == "directory"
end

--- Execute a system command and return its output. It returns two tables.
-- The first one contains each standard output line as a position.
-- The second one contains each error output line as a position.
-- @arg command A command.
-- @usage result, error = runCommand("dir")
function runCommand(command)
	mandatoryArgument(1, "string", command)

--- Return information about the current execution. The result is a table
-- with the values below. Some of them are read only, while others might
-- be changed accordingly.
-- @tabular NONE
-- Attribute & Description & Read only? \
-- autoclose & When a simulation creates graphical components (Chart, Map, etc.),
-- TerraME waits for the modeler to close them to finish its execution.
-- This attribute is a boolean value indicating whether TerraME should be
-- automatically closed after executing the simulation. & No \
-- color & A boolean value indicating whether text output might be colored. If colored,
-- errors are shown red, warnings are shown yellow, and some prints in executions
-- like -test and -doc might be green. This option can only be set from TerraME
-- command line (-color). & Yes \
-- currentFile & A File with the name of the file currently being executed. This
-- value only exists when the file is passed as argument to the command line. & Yes \
-- initialDir & A Directory where TerraME was executed. Whenever TerraME needs to
-- Package:import() a package and cannot find it in the installed packages, it tries
-- to load from this directory. & Yes \
-- dbVersion & A string with the current TerraLib version for databases. & Yes \
-- fullTraceback & A boolean value indicating whether TerraME should show all the
-- stack when an error occurs. This means that the lines from base package and
-- internal files are also going to be shown when an error occurs. As default, TerraME
-- does not show such lines. This value can be set from TerraME command line (-ft). & No \
-- interface & A boolean value indicating whether a graphical interface to configure
-- models is running. When this value is true, Utils:toLabel() converts errors to more
-- readable texts referring to graphical objects instead of Model arguments. & No \
-- mode & A string with the current mode for warnings ("normal", "debug", "quiet", or "strict").
-- Run terrame -help for a description of such modes. & No \
-- path & A string with the location of TerraME in the computer. & Yes \
-- round & A number used whenever it is possible to have rounding problems. For instance,
-- it works with Events that have period less than one by rounding the execution time of
-- an Event that is going to be scheduled to a future time if the difference between such
-- time and the closest integer number is less then the value of this argument. In this case,
-- if an Event that starts in time one and has period 0.1, it might execute in time 1.999999999,
-- as we are working with real number. This argument is then useful to make sure that such Event
-- will be executed in time exactly two. The default value is 1e-5. & No \
-- separator & A character with the directory separator. Each operational system has its
-- own separator. & Yes \
-- silent & A boolean value indicating whether print() calls should not be shown. This
-- value can only be set from TerraME command line (-silent). & Yes \
-- system & A string with the operating system. It is one of "windows", "linux", or "mac". & Yes \
-- version & A string with the current version of TerraME. & Yes
-- @usage print(sessionInfo().mode)
