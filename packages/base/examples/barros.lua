-- @example Implementation of Barros urban dynamics model.
-- It simulates a virtual city
-- composed by poor, middle class, and rich people. The simulation
-- starts with the city having only one inhabitant in the center
-- of space. At each time step, a new inhabitant arrives in the
-- center. As it is not possible to have more than one inhabitant in
-- the same cell, the arriving inhabitants with higher income can
-- replace those with lower income, which in turn need to search for
-- a new cell to leave, moving randomly. Empty cells can be occupied
-- by any kind of agent. \
-- Reference: Barros, J. "Simulating urban dynamics in Latin American cities."
-- GeoDynamics (2005): 313-328.
-- @arg P_POOR Percentage of poor agents.
-- @arg P_MIDDLE Percentage of middle class agents.
-- @arg P_RICH Percentage of rich agents. Note that the sum of the three percentages
-- must be one.
-- @arg DIM The x and y dimensions of space.
-- @arg AGENTS The number of agents in the simulation.
