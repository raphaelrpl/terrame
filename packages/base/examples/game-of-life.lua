-- @example Implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
-- It is a classical Cellular Automata model that simulates
-- changes in a society using very simple rules. Each cell
-- represents an individual that can have two states: alive or dead.
-- Using its own state and the state of its neighbors, each individual
-- decides its next state. The model has four rules. First,
-- an alive cell with fewer than two alive neighbors dies by loneliness.
-- Second, an alive cell with two or three alive neighbors stays alive.
-- Third, an alive cell with more than three alive neighbors dies
-- by over-population. Fourth, a dead cell with three alive neighbors
-- becomes alive by reproduction. \
-- This implementation creates the initial distribution of alive
-- cells randomly. \
-- For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life.
-- @arg PROBABILITY The probability of a Cell to be alive in the
-- beginning of the simulation. The default value is 0.15.
-- @arg TURNS The number of simulation steps. The default value is 20.
