  \file message.h
  \brief This file contains definitions about the Message objects. Messages are dispatched by the
                 simulation engine Event objects. In general, a message is a function with several
                 calls to the TerraME API services (or API functions). Messages run Agent objects
                 over the CellularSpace objects, carry out the communication between Agent objects,
                 report model result, synchronize or load or save Cellular space in the geographical database.
                 Handles: Message
                 Implementations: MessageImpl
